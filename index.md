Tina's parents are generously hosting the whole shabang on their property in Mauston, Wisconsin.

There's a lake for swimming/kayaking and even a [small campground if you want to stay on location](./lodging.html).

If you'd like to learn more about the venue [click here.](/venue.html)

## What is the dress code?

**Extremely** casual. This will be an _outdoor_ _summertime_ wedding in rural Wisconsin, so dress to beat the heat. Don't be the guy who shows up in a fancy suit--we might be forced to throw you in the lake. Which reminds me: don't forget to bring a swimsuit! ðŸ‘™ ðŸ©³ ðŸ©± 

## Is there a gift registry?

**No gifts please.** We already have a home/kitchen filled with everything we need ðŸ˜ƒ. We realize this wedding is likely to incur many travel expenses, so we don't want to shake our friends and family down for cast iron pans etc. If you insist on flexing your wealth, feel free to [donate to our honeymoon gofundme](https://gofund.me/cd2cff93). However that is completely optional; celebrating with you and your loved ones will be gift enough.

## Can I bring my dogs/children?

Yes! However, children must remain on a leash at all times. ðŸ˜œ
